# bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to view the data trends for the Citibike program in New York in order to help create an informed recommendation for setting up a similar program in another urban area.

## Results:
1) The Bike usage data trends follow business hour and rush hour trends across weekdays and hours.

2) Men use the bike share prgram significantly more than women.

3) Starting Locations correlate to population density.

## Summary:
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.

We can conclude with this study that the most significant times and locations to provide bikes are rush hour business and tourist areas.
One takeaway from this is that if we do not provide a strong infrastructure solution from the beginning to keep bikes available at these times in these locations, we will be losing a lot of first-time customers.

Another takeaway is that we need to research more into why women do not use the program as much as men. Are there any problems that we can address from the beginning to make this service more attractive to women?

One additional visualization that I would perform would be adding a "subscriber / customer" layer to the trip durations. This would let us see how to target our marketting. (Are subsribers taking shorter trips, and are tourists and visitors taking more leisurely long trips?)

Another additional visualization I would perform would be adding a "subscriber / customer" layer to the starting locations map. Is there any geographical difference between the subscriber and customer? This may help us in determining where our advertising targets are put up around the city.
